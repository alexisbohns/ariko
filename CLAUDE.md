# CLAUDE.md — working in the Ariko repo

Ariko is a personal "central node": a portfolio on an atomic content model
(`Molecule → Atom → Version`), Next.js 15 / React 19 / TypeScript / MongoDB.
The admin and public zones are intentionally **zero-CSS, no client JS, no UI
framework** until an artistic direction is set. Orientation lives in
[`README.md`](README.md); the sequenced plan lives in
[`docs/superpowers/ROADMAP.md`](docs/superpowers/ROADMAP.md).

## Lab Note requirement — read before opening a PR

Ariko is wired to several repos' CIs (`ariko`, `pbbls`, `femfolk`, `arkaik`,
`melogram`). **When you open a PR that ships something a user, visitor, or
listener would notice, you MUST include a Lab Note in the PR body.** Merging the
PR posts it to the Ariko inbox automatically — no copy-paste.

This section is the always-loaded summary and is **self-sufficient**: you can
author a valid note from it alone, with no plugin installed. The `lab-note`
skill (installable via `/plugin install lab-note@ariko`) is the source of truth
for full tone guidance and the per-repo molecule table.

**The gate.** User/visitor/listener-facing change → write a note. Chore,
refactor, infra, or docs-only change → **no note** (leave the section out; if the
advisory reminder comments on your PR, add the **`no-lab-note`** label to silence
it).

**The contract.** One section whose heading **starts with** `## Lab Note`,
containing exactly one ` ```yaml ` fence. `en.title` and `en.summary` are
**required**; `fr.*` is recommended (a real adaptation, not a literal
translation, using the informal "Tu"); `suggested` is optional. Unknown
top-level keys are ignored. Skeleton:

```yaml
en:
  title: Short, benefit-first title             # required
  summary: One or two sentences, user-facing.   # required
fr:                                             # recommended — adaptation, informal "Tu"
  title: Titre court, orienté bénéfice
  summary: Une ou deux phrases, adaptées, pas traduites littéralement.
suggested:                                      # optional — prefills triage in the Ariko admin
  molecule: ariko        # THIS repo's molecule slug
  type: feature          # feature | improvement | fix | announcement
  tags: [changelog]
  # atom: <slug>         # ONLY when you know the slug exists — never guess
```

**Tone.** Lead with the benefit, not the mechanism; keep it short; warm and a
little playful, never corporate; no engineering jargon, ticket numbers, or
internal names.

**This repo's molecule slug is `ariko`.** A malformed note fails the post-on-merge
job loudly (e.g. `en.title is required`); the advisory reminder surfaces the same
problems at PR-open time. Fix by editing the PR body — posting is idempotent.
